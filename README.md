## CLI Task Runner App

Steps:

1. Run "cmake CMakeLists.txt" from the root directory.

2. Follow up with running "make task-cli" to generate task-cli executable.

3. Use executable generated from last step ..  `./task-cli add "Pick up Groceries"`


> No need to create "example.json". The code will take care of it.
